## üéØ How It Works

1. **Round Start**: Plugin activates the spawn period monitoring for the configured duration
2. **C4 Drop Detection**: When a terrorist drops the C4 during the spawn period, the plugin tracks the dropping player
3. **Auto-Transfer**: After the configured delay, the plugin finds the nearest alive terrorist (excluding the original dropper) and automatically transfers the C4
4. **Player Feedback**: The receiving player gets a chat notification confirming they received the C4
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: The plugin handles round end cleanup and player disconnections
